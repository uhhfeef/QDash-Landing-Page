## Usage Guide

### Creating Your First Dashboard

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Tips for Best Results

   - Ensure your CSV files have clear column headers
   - Clean your data before uploading
   - Remove any unnecessary columns

2. **Query Tips**:
   - Be specific about the chart type you want
   - Mention the columns or metrics you're interested in
   - Specify any filters or time ranges
